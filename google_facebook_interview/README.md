Once upon a time I was watching videos on youtube and came upon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tYoVx0QoN0

I paused the video as they were starting the actual coding section and started working on a solution for myself.

I came up with all but one line of the python script in this directory during their 45 minute session - I forgot to set result = False on line 21, and spent another ten minutes or so figuring that out.

I then skimmed the coding section of the video and was a bit blown away. I'm happy with my solution.
